## Limitations
Due to a free Spotify Developer account, only 25 people can be given access for authorization, otherwise we have to submit a quota extension request. This is keeping in mind the number of API calls and load that Spotify servers have to manage. Hence, I have created a dummy Spotify account which can be used to login and view the project.
